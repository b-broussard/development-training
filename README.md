##Purpose

I'm undertaking the endeavor of solving at least one coding challenge daily for 6 months. This repository serves as the locus of all of my solutions to such challenges found around the Internet. Each training site will have its own directory.

##FAQ

As part of my commitment to provide a better life for my family of five as a husband and father, I made the choice to begin this journey on the 15th of January, 2020.

####_What languages do you plan on working with?_

At the time of this writing, I'm working with JavaScript in an effort to prepare for front end web development-oriented interviews.

This is sitting in the back of my mind at the moment. I have a strong inclination to try but a lot of planning remaining to ensure a productive and fruitful experience can be had by all.
