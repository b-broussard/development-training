## **Purpose**

I'm undertaking the endeavor of solving at least one coding challenge daily for 6 months. This repository serves as the locus of all of my solutions to such challenges found around the Internet. Each training site will have its own directory.

## FAQ

#### _When did you start this challenge?_

As part of my commitment to provide a better life for my family of five as a husband and father, I made the choice to begin this journey on the 15th of January, 2020.

#### _What languages do you plan on working with?_

At the time of this writing, I'm working with JavaScript in an effort to prepare for front end web development-oriented interviews.

#### _Are you streaming your work on Twitch/YouTube?_

This is sitting in the back of my mind at the moment. I have a strong inclination to try but a lot of planning remaining to ensure a productive and fruitful experience can be had by all.

#### _Where could I see your solution code?_

Following is a list of services through which I've solved at least one puzzle or problem. If applicable, a link will be provided to show all such solutions for that service. This list will be updated often, so do check back from time to time!

_Note:_ The code I have hosted here will contain my long-form comments, while the solutions hosted on these services will most likely have just the code itself along with any explanatory comments as necessary.
